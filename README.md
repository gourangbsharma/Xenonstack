I created a website with PHP and MySQL involves using PHP to create the dynamic content of the website, while MySQL is used to store and retrieve data from a database. Here are the steps I used to create a website with PHP and MySQL:

Decided on the purpose of your website, the features you want to include, and the design of the website.

I installed a web server such as Apache on my computer.

I installed MySQL database to store and retrieve data from your website.

I wrote PHP code using VS Code. I used functions like mysqli_connect() to connect to your MySQL database, and functions like mysqli_query() to retrieve data from the database.

I used a graphical tool like phpMyAdmin to create a database and tables to store data for your website.

The login and signup details are stored in the database and the the contact us form data is also stored in the database.

I Use HTML and CSS to create the layout and design of your website.

Upload the website: Once you have completed testing your website, you can upload it to your web server or web hosting service.
